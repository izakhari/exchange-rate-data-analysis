### Challenge
Connect to any exchange rates API (Sample - Exchange Rates API) to get exchange rates of Australia to New Zealand for the past 30 days into json output format
Pre process the data to manage any expected issues
Perform some data analysis
Find the best and worst exchange rates for that time period
Calculate the average exchange rate for the month
Feel free to add any additional features or optimizations that you think are relevant and show off your skills.

### Submission
Github/any open public repository preferred.

### Expected artefacts
As required please share:
- Documentation – Approach, architecture, best standard followed in the coding etc
- Code Snippets
- Output results as appropritate
- Testing scenario’s
- Source files.

### Environment and Access
Open-source python complier can be used (Jupyter Notebook etc)

### Evaluation Criteria
The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness
- Code structure
- Extensibility
- Maintainability
- Test coverage
- Performance
